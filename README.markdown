Talus' TPL
==========
A templating engine in PHP, using a XML syntax like, and a parser based on PCREs. The name is temporary. 

**Requires** at least *PHP 5.1*, because of the utilisation of the Standard PHP Library and several object specifications available only since 5.1. Compatible PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3.

For any pieces of documentation, check the [official site](http://www.talus-works.net) ([Talus' TPL > Documentation](http://www.talus-works.net/forum-6-p1-rapports-de-bugs.html)).
It is still in french though ; the english version should "one day" be made (please don't ask when :D).

About this project...
---------------------
This project was initiated as a fork "from scratch" from the templating engine of the [Fire Soft Board](http://www.fire-soft-board.com) project. It also has some stuff inspired from the PHPBB3 and Django's templating engines.
