About this project...
---------------------
This project was initiated as a fork "from scratch" from the templating engine of the [Fire Soft Board](http://www.fire-soft-board.com) project. It also has some stuff inspired from the [Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig)'s, [PHPBB3](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3)'s and [Django](https://github.com/django/django)'s templating engines.
